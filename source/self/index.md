It's hart to predict what everyone is expecting for, so I'll just list some Q&As here. It's a little colloquial but also quite interesting, you know, when Qs really want an A.

# Projects/Demos list

In case you miss the links in Q&As.

- [Project Euler repo](https://github.com/kongscn/euler): Algorithm exercises.
- [TA+AI](http://blog.kongscn.me/2014/11/23/algorithmic-trading-machine-learning.html): A demo that combines technical analysis with machine learning in trading algorithms.
- [Python Performance](http://blog.kongscn.me/2014/11/10/cython-performance.html): Python, Cython, Dlang, Julia and C performance comparison of a particular physics problem.

# Q&As

**Q**: Are you familiar with Algorithms?

**A**: No. But I spent some time working with [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) years algo([repo](https://github.com/kongscn/euler)). I'm interested about delicate programs solving difficult problems, but I seldom find myself under a situation when I have to implement an algo myself in practice. I prefer to spend time on something obviously very useful, like [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), and take algos as some free toy. But I think I can learn and implement an algo that is necessary in few time. Here is [gist](https://gist.github.com/kongscn/d47fa9cbe8055faf1114) of a [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) implementation of quick sort that I wrote when I was reading that interesting language months algo:

**Q**: Why isn't C/matlab your best languages while you are interested about quant?

**A**: I am interested about learning programming languages and I do use some of them. But I prefer to use Python/R for data analysis. Descriptive statistics? Monte Carlo? MCMC? Visulization? Big data? Machine learning? Fine, you already have all the tools you need. For example, you can combine traditional technical analysis with machine learning models in backtesting trading, as easy as plug one function(my [demo](http://blog.kongscn.me/2014/11/23/algorithmic-trading-machine-learning.html)). Python/R is generally fast enough for your problems as long as you are writing the proper code with the right tool, and P/R scripts can be optimized with languages like C([here](http://blog.kongscn.me/2014/11/10/cython-performance.html) is a test that I compared Python, Cython, Dlang, Julia and C for a particular physis problem).

**Q**: What is the first time after 3PM when the hour and minute hands of a clock are exactly on top of each other?

**A**: Questions like this one are not suprising, I read some pages of books about quantative interviews, and in fact I spent some time on them last year(late 2014), the questions are indeed interesting. I admit that brains usually need some practice to be good at questions like filling blanks of a number array, or how to get out of a can if you are as small as an insect, but the problem is there are **more** interesting things around. Personally I'm interested about many things, including psychology, traditional literature, programming languages etc., in short I am willing to touch logics/ideas, and I prefer to feel/understand/index them than to rember them. I get used to learn and accept things quickly, not remembering them. This might not be the better way, or even the right way, but it's more difficult to keep blind to the wilde world and only follow the rules made by ABC.
